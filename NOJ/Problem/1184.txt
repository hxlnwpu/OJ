    描述
   
    In this problem, you're to calculate the distance between a point P(xp, yp, zp) and a segment (x1, y1, z1) - (x2, y2, z2), in a 3D space, i.e. the minimal distance from P to any point Q(xq, yq, zq) on the segment (a segment is part of a line).
    
    输入
   
    The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000), the number of test cases. Each test case is a single line containing 9 integers xp, yp, zp, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2. These integers are all in [-1000,1000].
    
    输出
   
    For each test case, print the minimal distance, to two decimal places.
