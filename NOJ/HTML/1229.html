   <div class="panel_content">
    Farmer John has built a sand castle! Like all good castles, the
    <br/>
    walls have crennelations, that nifty pattern of embrasures (gaps)
    <br/>
    and merlons (filled spaces); see the diagram below. The N (1 &lt;= N
    <br/>
    &lt;= 25,000) merlons of his castle wall are conveniently numbered
    <br/>
    1..N; merlon i has height M_i (1 &lt;= M_i &lt;= 100,000); his merlons
    <br/>
    often have varying heights, unlike so many.
    <br/>
    He wishes to modify the castle design in the following fashion: he
    <br/>
    has a list of numbers B_1 through B_N (1 &lt;= B_i &lt;= 100,000), and
    <br/>
    wants to change the merlon heights to those heights B_1, ..., B_N
    <br/>
    in some order (not necessarily the order given or any other order
    <br/>
    derived from the data).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To do this, he has hired some bovine craftsmen to raise and lower
    <br/>
    the merlons' heights. Craftsmen, of course, cost a lot of money.
    <br/>
    In particular, they charge FJ a total X (1 &lt;= X &lt;= 100) money per
    <br/>
    unit height added and Y (1 &lt;= Y &lt;= 100) money per unit height
    <br/>
    reduced.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FJ would like to know the cheapest possible cost of modifying his
    <br/>
    sand castle if he picks the best permutation of heights. The answer
    <br/>
    is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit signed integer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: about 40% of the test data will have N &lt;= 9, and about 60% will have
    <br/>
    N &lt;= 18.

    INPUT DETAILS:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FJ's castle starts with heights of 3, 1, and 1. He would like to change
    <br/>
    them so that their heights are 1, 2, and 2, in some order. It costs 6 to
    <br/>
    add a unit of height and 5 to remove a unit of height.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    OUTPUT DETAILS:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    FJ reduces the first merlon's height by 1, for a cost of 5 (yielding
    <br/>
    merlons of heights 2, 1, and 1). He then adds one unit of height
    <br/>
    to the second merlon for a cost of 6 (yielding merlons of heights
    <br/>
    2, 2, and 1).
