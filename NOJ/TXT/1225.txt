    描述
   
    Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows, conveniently numbered
    
    1..N, are once again standing in a row. Cow i has height H_i (1 <=
    
    H_i <= 1,000,000).
    
    Each cow is looking to her left toward those with higher index
    
    numbers. We say that cow i 'looks up' to cow j if i < j and H_i <
    
    H_j. For each cow i, FJ would like to know the index of the first
    
    cow in line looked up to by cow i.
    
    Note: about 50% of the test data will have N <= 1,000.
   
    输入
   
    * Line 1: A single integer: N
    
    * Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the single integer: H_i
   
    输出
   
    * Lines 1..N: Line i contains a single integer representing the
    
    smallest index of a cow up to which cow i looks. If no such
    
    cow exists, print 0.
