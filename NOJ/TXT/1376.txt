    描述
   
    Children are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. Many find the "carry" operation - in which a 1 is carried from one digit position to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge. Your job is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition problems so that educators may assess their difficulty.
    
    输入
